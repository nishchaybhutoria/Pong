# Pong
Atari's pong game - recreated in python.

There are 2 players: Player 1 & Player 2.
Player 2 is **AI** controlled.
You need to control player 1 using the up and down arrows.
The goal is not to let the ball reach your end. If it does, the opponent is awarded a point.
I used pygame, sys, random, os and time modules. 
*Pygame does not come installed with python, so if you need to install it, just open command line and type 'pip install pygame'*.
Good luck!
